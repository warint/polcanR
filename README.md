on this period containing one or more of the following hashtags:

## How-To

### Getting the data

A user needs to enter the ISO code of a country. To have access to this
code, the following function provides this information.

``` r
polcanR::polcanr_data() # All the tweets, in all languages between August 15, 2021 (election call) and September 20, 2021 (end of the election).
polcanR::polcanr_data(dates = "2021-09-01") # All the tweets, in all languages on September 1,  2021.
polcanR::polcanr_data(languages = "en") # All the tweets in English between August 15, 2021 (election call) and September 20, 2021 (end of the election).
polcanR::polcanr_data(dates = c("2021-08-15", "2021-09-20"),languages = c("en","fr")) # All the tweets in English and French on August 15, 2021 and September 20, 2021.
```
